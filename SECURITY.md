## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, click Issues and create a new one, starting the title with 'Vulnerability'.

We check on our Issues every month or so and will update immediately if they are valid. 
If your vulnerability is approved, we will try our best to fix it, and if declined, you will get radio silence or have your Issue deleted.
